Dependencies
============

soaplib     -  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/soaplib
psycopg2    - currently requires postgres & psycopg2 for stored procedure
python-ldap
python-lxml
django 1.1

Extensions
==========
We rely on a couple of externally-developed extensions. They need to be
downloaded added to the python path. Extensions are listed in settings.py
and annotated with where they can be downloaded. Put them into a directory
and add that local path to the EXTENSION_DIRS in localsettings.py.


Installation
==========
Create PostGres database and grant privileges to user
Copy pidman/localsettings-example.py to pidman/localsettings.py
Configure localsettings
Execute the following:
    pidman/manage.py syncdb
    pidman/manage.py migrate
    
To verify installation execute without errors
    pidman/manage.py test


Unit Tests
==========
All unit tests should be run EXCEPT for the ones in linkcheck module.
Currently they are not compatible with django 1.1.  To  run unit tests use the
following command while in the pidman directory:
python ./manage.py test auth admin contenttypes sessions sites soap_api pid pidauth resolver usage_stats
