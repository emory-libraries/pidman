[2009-06-10 rsutton] How to setup a test environment for the resolver.
	The current pid resolver runs under mod_python, and getting a test environment set up where you can run it takes a bit of configuration.

	Assuming you have a linux workstation with apache2 installed and mod_python enabled, edit your apache default site (or create a new site) and add a new virtual host:

	<VirtualHost *:80>
			ServerName mypidtest.library.emory.edu
			DocumentRoot /path/to/workingcopy/persis/resolver

			RewriteEngine On
			RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/resolver
			RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://mypidtest.library.emory.edu/resolver/handler?query=$1 [L]

			<Directory /path/to/workingcopy/persis/resolver>
					SetHandler mod_python
					PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
					PythonDebug On
			</Directory>
	</VirtualHost>

	Edit your /etc/hosts so that the hostname for your new virtual host, mypidtest.library.emory.edu, also resolves to your workstation.

	Restart apache.

	Now you can use urls similar to production pids and arks to test the resolver, e.g.

	http://mypidtest.library.emory.edu/ark:/23395/1qqn

	 

	Note: mod_python apparently
